For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a \"jump\" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The \"booster car\" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.The technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a \"dead\" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the \"dead\" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!

THESE are jumper cables.  Let me explain.When you're in a bind on some dark night in some parking lot somewhere and your battery is dead, you need to get out of there pronto.In times like that, it's much easier to get a jump if YOU own a set of jumper cables.  It's double good if those jumper cables are long so that they can easily reach the battery of a good samaritan.  Now, according to electrical theory in order for DC current to flow across long distances, you need thicker cable.That's where these cables come in, they're long at 25' and thick at 2gauge.That's what these cables provide, maximum length at near maximum gauge cable.  And yes, your jumper cables SHOULD cost close to as much as your spare tire because that's what you need --- just look up the cost of copper on the market (that stuff is expensive).Yes, you can buy a $17 set of 10 foot, 18 gauge cables out there but if they can't reach between cars or if they can't carry enough power to start your car, you might as well have been lugging a brick in your trunk all those years and you might as well have enjoyed a good lunch with the $17 for all the false confidence it gave you.  I'm serious, buy an extension cord for $5 and you get as much jumping potential as many of the so called 'jumper' cables on the market --- there should be laws against marketing products that cannot jump start a car.  Worse, having no cables or less-than-worthless cables means that a criminal might reach you before you can get a jump and make your getaway.At the end of the day, you want a 25' or 20' cable, so you better be looking at 2gauge or 4 gauge cable - no compromises there.  You can go to 6gauge if you're working your way down to 16' cables.  But, the reality is that you always need a few extra feet when trying to jump start someone's car parked in some tight parking space --- so you're back to the 25' and 2 gauge.Pros- I know I can jump start a Semi with these (more importantly, I can get a jump from a Semi - Truck drivers are the good guys btw)- Extra long at 25'- Parrot clamp are strong, but an average guy can open them with one hand- Copper inserts in the parrot clamps is nice- Clamps are rated at 500amps- they're friggin heavy at near 14lbs, yes that's a pro!  that means there's 14 POUNDS of Copper in there and that's what allows the current to flow as freely as the Amazon river (no pun intended). It's huge.Cons- I do have an issue that the copper cable is not attached to the copper inserts in the clamps, it screws into the metal clamp rather than into the copper insert.  I don't know if that's a mistake or not.  I'm thinking about doing a bit of retrofitting.  I'm sure it's more than enough the way it is.Overall, these are as close an approximation to the kind of jumper cables that my dad had when I was growing up.  He custom made his -- he's old school.Anyway, if you're going to carry jumper cables, and you should --- don't muck around -- spend the dough, get these --- they'll last a lifetime and will not let you down.Advice, after you get a jump don't waste time rolling these things up in some dark parking lot -- just toss the heavy mangled mess into your trunk and get home.  There's always time the next day to roll these monsters back up and get them ready for the next wild adventure you might have.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Jumper Cables - The Real Deal", "unixReviewTime": 1287705600, "reviewTime": "10 22, 2010"}

For that you'll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY!  Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost!  So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use, I'd say these are gonna work for you.(Update: After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car, they don't really seem that much thicker...  That's said they are MUCH heavier!  The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I'm guessing that's why the thickness isn't much more...)What I like:--Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup.  Why?  Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides.  Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you.--Heft - these cables are no joke.  It's a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow.  When trying to start a 5.7L V8, that's kinda important.--Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand.  But their hardly weak, they'll clamp solid and stay put!(Update: If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these, Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $150.  I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good.)What I don't like:--Stiffness - They're not as flexible as I was hoping.  But about as flexible as I expected.  True welding cable in 2ga is about $3 per foot and per cable.  That's why the best jumper cables cost $200+.  Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty.--Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable doesn't go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws.  Instead.  It's screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body.  Still fine I'm sure.So why buy these cables aren't they overkill?  I've had this argument with people before: \"My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine.\"  Well I will attempt to addess this.  As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases.  In other words 2ga has more (perhaps 50-100% more) conductor than 4ga.  This doesn't automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely.  For those that aren't aware (and I'm not an electrical engineer here), resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts.  Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together.  Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size.  Ambient temperature, conductor, line distance, voltage, and amperage.  Ambient temp we have no control over.  Hot is bad so just assume the worst.  This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing.  Conductor of these is copper so that's good.  You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor.  Distance and voltage.  One of these cable's strengths also happens to be a weakness.  Total run length for this circut is 50'.  Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop.  12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance.  So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this.  Amperage is also a big consideration.  The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate.  Basically on a small wire, a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen. 1) the wire will melt and/or catch on fire.  2) The load your trying to power won't work.  And make no mistake, starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy!  So bringing it all together.  Large load, low voltage (that we don't want to make in lower), and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find.  Addressing the orignal question and statment.  6' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine.  But if you want or need the extra length, you need to consider heavy gauge cables.  That said I've personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you?  So these will run you close to $100 shipped...do you actaully need them?  I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25' booster cables.  Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this.  The 4ga will do you fine at the 25' length for engines up to 5-liters or so (and honestly probably up to about 6L as well.)  Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment.  Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected.  Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag.  I have the Arsenal #5888 cable organizer and it works great for this.

This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness.

He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed. And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on. He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it.I use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover. If you have a garage, it's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night, even garaged. You won't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster. And dust won't build up if you use it often enough.Before discovering the California Duster, I found that after washing my car, I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over. Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer, which in turn means I don't have to wash the car nearly as often.I got the plastic handle California Duster which was significantly cheaper at the time I ordered. Although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer, the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy, for the value oriented, get the plastic handle one since it's the exact same brush anyway!I am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle.

I have a dark grey/charcoal colored interior that is patterned and almost feels 'sticky' to the touch for lack of a water word.  Using a microfiber cloth didn't really clean up the dust too well and another duster I picked up here works ok on the radio console and steering wheel but not on the dash itself.Despite a few negative reviews here I decided to give it a go after a recent price drop.  Picked this up for $4.63 when I figured I didn't have much to lose.Put it out on the porch for two days on a stack of newspapers as was suggested.  After that I gave it a bunch of really good shakes and then ran my fingers thru the fibers a few times trying to get out any of the lose ones.  That seemed to do the trick because I haven't had any issues with stray red fibers all over the place or the pad falling apart as I've read in previous reviews.Shortly after I went out to the car and cleaned the outside and the inside.  Shook it out a bunch and it seemed to work great on the dash which has been a PITA since I bought the car.  Afterwards I brought it inside and used it to dust my entire first floor of my house.  This included behind my tv and entertainment center, on top of my refrigerator and all those other places normally buried in dust.  Worked like a charm, sucked it all up and didn't let go.So I'd have to say this, just like it big brother, the Original, works like a charm.

It cuts car drying time at least in half, maybe more, plus the effort to dry with this towel is less than with a standard towel or chamois.  If the car is in the sun or if you have hard water or if you are meticulous about your car, it may be a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the car after you use the Absorber to get the rest of the water off and to ensure no spots/streaks get  left behind.  When you are done, just wring most of the water out of the Absorber and roll it back into its plastic container for next time.  This is a great product for car drying or for cleaning up wet spills.

It's certainly super absorbant, but doesn't have the chamois quality I would need to, say, polish my bike frames.  That is to say it's more sticky than soft, more like a piece of foam rubber or neoprene than a cloth.So if I just hosed down the bike while cleaning and wanted to get on with the next steps of polishing and relubing, this towel is a great way to dry the bike when it's neither hot nor dry enough of a day for the bike to dry out on it's own in a fair amount of time.It really draws the water out too, from every knook and cranny, so no need to use DW-40 before lubing my nice clean parts.My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that can't go in the dryer.  If you wash a sweater for example, it's best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry, as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.We use my far more grungy one as you might use a wet vac.  It actually does a better job than a wet vac though.Add that I've used several gum towels in Japan, mostly for swimming, and this is by far the thickest one I've used--therefore more absorbant.  And at 27\" x 17\" it's big enough to be used as a bath towel without having to ring it out over and over again.BOTTOM LINE:I recommend this particular make and model over others simply based on the large size and the thickness of the towel.Don't expect to use this to polish or dust, as the texture of the towel is far too sticky for that.I initially searched for the Sham-Wow on Amazon because I had seen it on TV, and still would like to try it out because it seems like it might be more chamois like--where you could wipe and polish with it.Overall, we're thrilled with the quality, size, and how well this item works.

It works well, and if you are very certain your freshly washed car is free from all debris, you will likely not cause any scratching. However, if you pick up some rogue sand granule or some other debris, you could cause clear coat damage.After watching an episode of Drive Clean and seeing them use microfiber towels in the same manner, I made the switch. It takes a little longer, but the microfiber towel is marginally safer on your precious paint job and if you're auto obsessed, it may be worth the extra time. The microfiber are also easier to clean, just wash and dry and you are on your way. This thing will get mold unless you let it dry out completely and is a pain to wash by hand.

This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Absorber", "unixReviewTime": 1318032000, "reviewTime": "10 8, 2011"}

The Absorber is PVA, so it needs to stay a little wet because it gets very stiff when dry. Once you get used to it and how it works, it's great. There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper, but believe me, this one is superior in thickness and quality. I bought a cheap, generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you'd use a normal towel for. It won't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with, but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest. The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge, depending on how wet it is. It's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat. When it gets too wet, you just wring it out. When it gets a little dirty, soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer (just make sure you don't put it in the dryer, it comes out of the washer slightly damp, just like it should be stored).

I thought I had found the best shine wax protection using an rv wax called protect-all with UV inhibitors in it prior to trying this Flagship wax and used it for years and it did the job and nothing else on the market ( so I thought) was going to top it for fiberglass. I use McGuires Fiberglass restorer and that did the most amazing removal of oxidation on an older RV I restored back to new so I knew it had to be good and tried it.I ADDED REVISED REVIEW TO END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW ON THIS PAGE.........................................................................................................................Well after applying this Flagship wax to my already clean and shiny RV it took the shine to a whole higher level. 1st off it does go on easy, once on its stays kind of moist like but drys SOFT LIKE but it comes off nice, then I follow with 2nd dry cloth to make sure its completly off and shiny and it does come off easy and it does clean finish up leaving a nice shiny glazed surface. But you need to change up rags often because it cakes and smears if you dont.I read reviews on Amazon which enticed me to give it a try. One said dont let dry any longer then 3 min and bottle claims same ( This is very true I am so pleased at results.The biggest improvment was the nice gold painted bottom of the Motorhome where the paint looked good before but now the paint looks glazed, shiny, and rich like I never was able to get this high a shine before. It also does not cling to plastic, windows or rubber everything it touches it comes off of leaving a high shine on it, So I used it on everything.NOW THIS IS MY REVISED REVIEW AS OF AUGUST 2013. AFTER USING THIS AND LIKING IT AT 1ST... I FOUND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BEAD BUT WATER STREAKS SEEM TO STICK AND STAY ON WAXED SURFACE ON FIBERGLASS EVEN WASHING WONT REMOVE THEM EASY. SO I WENT BACK TO USING PROTECT-ALL ON MY RV. IT SHINES AS WELL BUT ALSO THE WATER STREAKS ARE MINIMAL AFTER A RAIN AND WASH OFF EASIER.I also find the protect-all brand wax to last long and come off cleaner after applying wax leaving a cleaner shine.Making it far easier to do a big RV in less time then Flagship wax. I FOUND fLAGSHIP TO BE CAKY THICK AND HARDER TO REMOVE AND HAVING TO CONSTANTLY GET FRESH RAGS TO MAKE IT EASY TO GET OFF.........So we tried it- liked it at first but then a week or so later found the flagship to not be as good as what I used for years in the Protect-all brand.

Then I used the standard hose and the nozzle would at best take the stream over the second story of the house with no problems.  While the stream was not a great as I would like it at least got there thusly making this nozzle super for getting at the upper windows.  Next, I placed the nozzle on the front of a hose end sprayer to test its ability to handle liquid weeder, fertilizer or detergent.  It did far better than the nozzle that comes with the hose end sprayer.  Old happy gardener.  When comparing the price of the unit to other available sprayers of similar quality I would have to go with some of the cheaper ones that are made of metal and not plastic.  Some, however, plastic sprayers are not all that bad and one heckuva lot cheaper than the almost $25 for this nozzle.  While it is not perfect, it does the job for what I specifically want to use it for.  Also, I used it on the truck to clean it and it did a decent job except in an effort to preserve water it is something of a pain to have to screw the nozzle each time you want to cut the water off.  In fact, it is doubtful that this nozzle will see vehicle washing again.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Nozzle if you have High Pressure", "unixReviewTime": 1244332800, "reviewTime": "06 7, 2009"}

You adjust the flow of water by turning the spray head at the front.  Water flow can be cut off at either end of the range, as the flow pattern goes from off, to a gentle sprinkle, to wide spray, and then narrowing into a beam, and then off again.  Because of the larger sized head, the \"ultimate\" nozzle has a larger area of coverage, and can deliver a larger volume of water.The nozzle does a decent job of diffusing water flow, producing a nice gentle flowing fountain of water suitable for watering potted plants or delicate flowers.  When adjusted more to a spray, it is well suited for vegetable gardens and general use.  This is however, nothing unique as far as sprinkler nozzles go.Fully open, the front aperture is about 0.12 inches in diameter, which produces a thicker stream of water than your typical cheapo nozzle.  Sometimes a thick stream is advantageous, but you will be using more water, and the increased water pressure may stress your plumbing.  Unless your system has high volume, and good water pressure, you may not be able to take full advantage this nozzle.The nozzle appears to be solidly built, and seems to work as advertised.  Unfortunately the aluminum parts on mine have a reddish finish, rather than green, which looks cooler.  Although it can deliver a higher volume of water, the assertion that it is the \"ultimate\" is perhaps an overstatement.  It does a good job, but not that much better than the various cheapo nozzles and spray guns.  The economy models typically don't last very long, so if \"the ultimate\" proves to be durable, it might be worth the premium cost.

Dynamat Xtreme is a butyl rubber compound covered by aluminum foil.  The butyl is viscoelastic - it has just the right consistency between solid and liquid to provide maximum sound damping.  The foil probably provides some level of fire resistance, since it is hard for a fire to develop without oxygen when it is sandwiched in between the metal layer.  Cheap alternatives that some people use include the asphalt based rolls of roof sealer.  However that stuff will smell bad when it heats up (whereas butyl doesn't have such odor) and it doesn't have an aluminum layer so it's more dangerous if it were to catch fire, and asphalt can ooze into a liquid.  The closest thing I have come across that resembles Dynamat Xtreme is Hard Cast Foil Grip 1402, a specialty tape sold to contractors for HVAC duct sealing.  This HVAC tape, a favorite of mine for all kind of sealing uses, is much thinner though.  It's also a butyl compound with a foil layer and is also very expensive.

There are some cheaper competitors that people swear are just as good and they may be, but I just don't trust them as much.  If you do your research you will even see that some people chose to use roofing material that you can buy at Home Depot.  Someone would have to be OUT OF THEIR MIND to put $20 worth of roofing tar into a $20,000+ vehicle.  The only negative thing people have to say about Dynamat is that it is priced high, but if you buy the bulk packs on Amazon you will save yourself a ton of money and is actually a pretty cost effective solution for DIY work.  I have looked around and Amazon has the best price anywhere.Main competitors and my impressions of them.  I have not purchased or used these product, but this is an idea of why I chose Dynamat over them.  I am not a car audio professional by any means.  This is the first time I used deadening on my car and I am writing this to help anyone else who is thinking of doing this.1) RAAMAudio RAAMmat + Ensolite Foam - Most cost effective &#34;legitimate&#34; option.2) Sound Deadener Showdown - &#34;CDL Tiles&#34; + Mass Loaded Vinyl.  SDS would be an interesting choice.  If you look through forums you will see some people who really like this stuff, but I found the website to be confusing and I could not truly make an informed decision one way or another.3)Fatmat:  Cheapest of all automotive dampeners, but one Google search of &#34;fatmat smell&#34; is all you need to know.  Some say it smells awful and some don't, but there is no chance I risk it.  This stuff is super cheap, does not deaden as well as competitors and stinks.  I would use home depot roofing material before this product.  Move on.And to the &#34;REAL&#34; competitor.4) Second Skin Audio- Damplifier Pro + Closed Cell Foam (CCF)-  Although I decided on dynamat, based on reviews and forum comments, I think that Second Skin Audios product line may in fact be superior to Dynamat, but I decided against it for a few reasons.  Damplifier Pro is a good bit heavier than Dynamat extreme.  For most, this isnt going to make a huge difference, but I am lining a performance car with more emphasis on performance than sound.  I want an improved sound system, but if the increase in weight is only going to improve things very minimally it is just not worth it to me.  A lot of people say that Dynamat is the most expensive, but a 36 sq. foot pack of Damplifier pro costs $204+ shipping.  They do have some coupons occasionally, but it is more expensive.The fact is Dynamat is proven to work and is trusted by professionals.  I do not think you can go wrong with Dynamat because the only bad thing people have to say about it is that the price is high which is a bit of a myth.  If you drive a big truck or SUV, want the absolute best sound and aren't as concerned with weight, I would think about the 80sq foot Damplifier Pro shop pack and CCF foam.I turned my trunk into a enclosure with Dynamat Xtreme.  I lined just about every surface, doubling up in a few critical areas and was able to line my trunk with this kit.  If you want to really go out and line an entire car, you will need 100 sq ft+ of this stuff.  If you are doing the trunk and doors like me, you'll need 50-80 sq feet depending on whether or not you plan to cover the entire door.  I would use the bulk kit for anything but the doors.  You can surely use the Dynamat in the bulk kit on the doors, but the door kit strips 12&#34; x 36&#34; and make for a cleaner install because they will run the full length of any door.  It would not be the end of the world to have extra, but I would try to make a good estimate of how much you will need so that you arent leftover with a whole box of this stuff.One final recommendation as I try to unload all of the information I have learned.  Dynamat claims that you do not need a heat gun to install Dynamat Extreme.  That may be true, but after using a heat gun to put the finishing touches on the trunk, I would have to strongly recommend using a heat gun for trouble areas and difficult corners.  I was able to put the Dynamat down so much flatter and nicer by heating it up a bit and rolling it down.  it especially helps to heat corners and tight spots where you cannot get the roller in, because it makes it easier to mash the Dynamat down with your fingers.  I am not going to use the heat gun on the doors however, as I believe that there are more heat sensitive components in there and do not want to chance it Dynamat claims it is not a necessity.I plan on using Dynaliner on top of the Dynamat in the doors (and trunk I think) as well as by itself in a few areas.  I really hope this helps someone.

With just the stock mirrors, any traffic directly behind the boat was absolutely invisible to me.  With the mirrors, that is no longer the case.I had two problems initially: one due to my own ineptness and the other due to being alone.  When I first got these out of the box and clipped them into the bottom of the door and the window groove, the horizontal bar was not horizontal at all.  Adjusting the straps straightened that out completely.  Also, the mirrors appeared to be fixed in position and any effort to move them seemed as if it might break them.  Well, there are three Phillips head screws that encircle the adjustment ball; loosen them and you can move the mirror any way you want.The major problem remains adjusting the passenger side mirror.  If I had somebody to move it for me, I could adjust it in just a minute while I sat in the driver's seat.  As it is, I had to get out, adjust the mirror, get back in, check the adjustment from the driver's seat and repeat ad nauseum until I finally got it right.  I don't fault the mirror for that.These mirrors come one to a box so you need to order two of them.

{"reviewerID": "A39AD95B47OEYX", "asin": "B00029WRJQ", "reviewerName": "Lg", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin.

The K&N filters catch dirt better than any of the paper filters.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "K&N Degreaser 32 oz", "unixReviewTime": 1379894400, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2013"}

My Neon doesn't care if I over oil it, but my truck has a mass airflow sensor, it does care... it cares a lot! Under-oiling it causes the fine mist of gravel dust through the filter, too much clogs it quickly and I guess that's better than it going into the engine but the MAF Sensor gets coated with the oil and that will cause performance issues that the filter may have given you.
