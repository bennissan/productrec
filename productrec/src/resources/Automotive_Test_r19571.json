I have some buds who live in their cars during the work week and they are going to love this thing.  It has too many USB charging ports (OK, four, but that's enough to make power cable spaghetti on the passenger seat) and an appropriately powered 110/120V outlet for a laptop or other non-USB powered toy.  I say \"appropriately powered\" because I've seen inverters sold with cigarette lighter adapters that are rated at way too many watts; enough to fry in-dash electronics and other car components if carelessly used (like, say, trying to run a hair dryer off of a cigarette-lighter-powered inverter and yes, there are people that, er, uh, careless out there).The little pamphlet that passes for a user manual looks like something you'd normally toss but if you haven't spent any time exploring inverter and battery basics it is worth a read.  You do *not* want to routinely run down your car battery charging stuff with this item while the engine is off...car batteries aren't designed for repeated discharge.  Use this thing while you're driving, not while you're parked with the engine off to avoid discharging your car battery.  Some items shouldn't be charged with this device and they're listed explicitly in the manual - take the suggestions seriously or you may toast such items.That said, most of the warnings are along the lines of \"don't stick your tongue in an electric socket while standing barefoot in a puddle\" and unless you really try, you'll have a hard time screwing up your car or your electronics with this gizmo.  The only downside is you have to give up a cup holder but since my car has about 70 of them it's not a huge deal for me.  Really nicely done!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Slick idea!  Pay attention to the manual.", "unixReviewTime": 1369180800, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2013"}
